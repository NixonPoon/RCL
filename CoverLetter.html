	<p class="coverletterP">Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

	<p class="coverletterP">I’m excited to be applying for the Environment Artist position with Ubisoft. If given a chance, I believe my skills, work ethic and positive attitude are ideal for the role.</p>


	<p class="coverletterP">I graduated from Gnomon School of Visual Effects specializing in Games track and began my career as an associate environment artist working on multiplayer in Call of Duty. Within the 2 years, I am involved in Core and Additional contents for multiplayer. I worked modularity and patch work for buildings, landscapes, and props. From sculpting, modeling and texturing, to world building in the game engine. On the side, I’ve explored photogrammetry and procedural modeling with Houdini to streamline my creative pipeline. I chose to present my work with Unreal Engine, in which I have use explore technical pipeline to easen my workflow.</p>


	<p class="coverletterP">The fast pacing environment has pushed me to become efficient, flexible, and self-reliant. It has motivated me to do more outside of work, venturing more into 3D to further equipped myself to be broader and be more utilitarian at work. I have experiences obtained from the last production through working in a multiplayer team.</p>


	<p class="coverletterP">Although I am used to working independently, I find that a supportive work environment with other artists and designers best suits me as a person with strong social skills, a positive attitude, and a team player. </p>


	<p class="coverletterP">If I was fortunate enough to be chosen for a position, I would bring my abilities, knowledge, and persistence to your team. I look forward to meeting you amazing team of artists, designers, and engineers. </p>

	<p class="coverletterP"><i>Sincerely,</i></p>
